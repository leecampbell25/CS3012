<h3> Lowest Common Ancestor </h3>

Lowest Common Ancestor 1 | 
------------ | 
To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree. The grading focus is on your test code. | 

Lowest Common Ancestor 2 | 
------------ | 
To enhance your previous LCA solution, implementing as a branch that you must ultimately merge with your master branch, an implementation of LCA that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form.|
