<h1> Lowest Common Ancestor </h1>

*Task: To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree. The grading focus is on your test code.*

<h3> Getting to know Haskell </h3>
This is my first attempt at using Haskell for a project, the recommended language for this module. Coming from an object-orientated base, I did find it a little bit of a struggle at the start and it took me a little longer to get to grips with the language than expected but it's certainly helped realise the power and use of the language.

<h3> Implementation and explantion of project folders </h3>

The project folder **Assignment 1** illustrates my orginal attempt at this task using basic hSpec unit testing. Using the extended deadline date and as I became more familiar with using *Haskell Stack*, I made a branch code_coverage of this attempt and re-arranged it into the *Haskell Stack* project format. This allowed me to expand on the the unit tests to achieve full code coverage using the *Haskell Stack* code coverage feature. 

The final implementation with full code coverage lies in **lca_assignment1**.
